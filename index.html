            <h3><a name="userstory">Follow the User Story Lifecycle diagram</a></h3>
            <p>When Lamar creates a User Story he puts it in the Product Backlog</p>
<p>at this point you may want to create a Change Ticket  for this User Story, since you will need at least a 7 day window between the time the Change Ticket is created and when you install to Production
</p>
            <p>
                Steps to take for "Plan to an Iteration Box" on User Story Lifecycle diagram
                -	Moving user stories from the Product Backlog to an Iteration as you begin working on them

            <p>
                2 different ways to do this
                1)
                -	Go to RTC
                -	Go to your product backlog (Plans / All Plans - Product Backlog should be at bottom of list)
                -	Hover over your User Story and drop down opens up to the left
                -	On drop down choose Plan For
                -	Either select an Iteration from the list
                -	Or browse and choose Iteration from list and click on OK
                -	Click on Save

            <p>
                2)
                -	Go to RTC
                -	Go to your product backlog (Plans / All Plans - should be at bottom of list)
                -	Click on your User Story
                -	On Planned For box click on the drop down
                -	select an Iteration from the list
                -	if you need to see more choices click on the 3 dots next to the open line
                -	click on Save

            <p>
                Moving a User Story from one Iteration to another
            <p>
                -	if your User Story is not finished by the end of the Iteration it is in, then you can move it and its Tasks that are not completed to another Iteration
            <p>
                -	see the attached document
                Moving User Story and Tasks to the Next Iteration.docx
            </p>

            <p>                Setting status of User Story to Dev Ready & Owning User Story
            <p>
                -	Go to the Iteration you put your User Story in (Plans / All Plans)

                -	If you do not see your User Story on the Taskboard, click on the Refresh icon (2 arrows in a circle pattern on top right to the left of Save button)
            <p>
                -	From the taskboard click on your User Story
            <p>
                -	You will now be on the Overview tab of the User Story

            <p>
                -	at the bottom of the Overview tab is the Discussion Box
            <p>
                -	under this box is a box labeled "Add a comment..."
            <p>
                -	click anywhere in this comment box and it opens up
            <p>
                -	now enter - AppScan not applicable - this is not a Web-based application
            <p>
                -	Click on Save (upper right corner of screen)
            <p>
                -	the status for your User Story can be found on the upper right corner (below Save button)
            <p>
                -	values for Status are on far left column of User Story Lifecycle diagram
            <p>
                -	the status will probably be New or Define (if it is already Dev Ready then skip down to the next section - Steps to take for "Decompose into Tasks Box")
            <p>
                -	drop down the status box and change the status until the status becomes Dev Ready (see below bullets)

                -	click on Save (the status will change to Dev Ready)
            <p>
                -	go to the next section Steps to take for "Decompose into Tasks Box"
